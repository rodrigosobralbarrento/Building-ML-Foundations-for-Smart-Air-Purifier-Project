# Building-ML-Foundations-for-Smart-Air-Purifier-Project

This project is a **practice exercise** where I apply **scikit-learn** to a synthetic fraud detection dataset.  
The goal is not to build a production fraud detection system, but to practice the **end-to-end machine learning workflow in Python**.

I plan to transfer these skills into my main **Air Purifier ML Project**, where I will use machine learning to predict when an air purifier should activate based on air quality and energy efficiency.

## üìå Project Goals
- Load and preprocess data using **pandas**.  
- Encode categorical variables with **LabelEncoder**.  
- Train a **Logistic Regression** model for binary classification.  
- Explore basic **correlations** between features and the fraud label.  
- Create an **interactive script** where a user enters transaction details and gets a fraud probability prediction.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. **Load Data**  
   - CSV file is read with pandas.  
   - Categorical columns (`Location`, `TransactionType`, `JobArea`, `ItemCategory`) are converted to integers using `LabelEncoder`.  

2. **Check Correlations**  
   - `pearsonr` computes linear correlations between each feature and the fraud label.  

3. **Train Model**  
   - Logistic Regression is trained on an 80/20 split of the data.  
   - `stratify=y` ensures the class balance (fraud vs. legitimate) is preserved.  

4. **User Prediction**  
   - The script prompts the user for transaction details.  
   - Inputs are encoded with the same encoders used in training.  
   - A fraud prediction and probability are displayed.
